# Counter
This repository contains a simple JavaScript counter project. The counter allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical value.
# Features
- Increment button to counter value by 1.
- Decrement button to counter value by 1.
- Reset button to counter value to 0.

# PseudoCode
- The counterValue variable holds the current value of the counter.
- The increment() function increases the counterValue by 1.
- The decrement() function decreases the counterValue by 1.
- The reset() function resets the counterValue to 0.
- The main program begins by displaying the initial counter value.
- It enters a loop where it waits for user input.
- Based on the user input (e.g., button click), the corresponding function is called, and the counter value is displayed.
- The program continues to loop until the user chooses to exit.

# Divide and Conquer
Now we have an idea of what the program will look like, let's implement.
